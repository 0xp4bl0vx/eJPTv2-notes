- The Meterpreter (Meta-lnterpreter) payload is an advanced multi-functional
payload that operates via DLL injection and is executed in memory on the target
system, consequently making it difficult to detect.
- It communicates over a stager socket and provides an attacker with an interactive
command interpreter on the target system that facilitates the execution of system
commands, file system navigation, keylogging and much more.
