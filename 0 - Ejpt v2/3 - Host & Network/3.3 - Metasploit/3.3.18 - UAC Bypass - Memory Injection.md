User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows security feature introduced in Windows Vista that is used to prevent unauthorized changes from being made to the operating system.

We can utilize the "Windows Escalate UAC Protection Bypass (In Memory Injection)" module to bypass UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off.

This exploit is useful for Windows Vista or later
