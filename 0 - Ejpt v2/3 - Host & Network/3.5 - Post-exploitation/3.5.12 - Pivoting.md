- Pivoting is a post exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host that is connected to multiple networks to gain access to systems within other networks.
# Port Forwarding
- Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system.
- In the context of pivoting, we can forward a remote port on a previously inaccessible host to a local port on our Kali Linux system so that we can remotely interact/exploit the service running on the port.
