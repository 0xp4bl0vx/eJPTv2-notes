AV software will typically utilize signature, heuristic and behaviour based detection.
1. Siqnature based detection - An AV signature is a unique sequence of bytes that uniquely
identifies malware. As a result, you will have to ensure that your obfuscated exploit or payload
doesn't match any known signature in the AV database.
We can bypass signature-based detection by modifying the malware's byte sequence,
therefore changing the signature.
2. Heuristic-based detection - Relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is
malicious. It also looks for specific patterns within the code or program calls.
3. Behavior based detection - Relies on identifying malware by monitoring it's behavior. (Used
for newer strains of malware)

## On-disk Evasion Techniques
- Obfuscation - Obfuscation refers to the process of concealing something important, valuable, or critical. Obfuscation reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or
- Encoding - Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process; data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format.
- Packing - Generate executable with new binary structure with a smaller size and therefore provides the payload with a new signature.
- Crypters - Encrypts code or payloads and decrypts the encrypted code in memory. The decryption key/function is usually stored in a stub.

## In-Memory Evasion Techniques
- Focuses on manipulation of memory and does not write files to disk.
- Injects payload into a process by leveraging various Windows APIs.
- Payload is then executed in memory in a separate thread.

# Installing and AV evasion
```
sudo apt install shellter
dpkg --add-architecture i386 - add x86 packages
sudo apt install wine32 - shellter only work with x86 binaries

cd /usr/share/windows-resources/shellter
cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/vncviewer . - or any basic x86 binary
sudo wine shellther.exe
> A - auto operation mode
> EXECUTABLE.EXE
> Y - enable stealth mode to maintain normal execution of program
> SELEC PAYLOAD
```
