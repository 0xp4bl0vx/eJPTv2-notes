# Kernel
A Kernel is a computer program that is the core of an operating system and has
complete control over every resource and hardware on a system. It acts as a translation
layer between hardware and software and facilitates the communication between
these two layers.

# Windows Kernel
Windows NT is the kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft
Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user
design philosophy. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to
system resources and hardware:
- User Mode — Programs and services running in user mode have limited access to
system resources and functionality.
- Kernel Mode — Kernel mode has unrestricted access to system resources and
functionality with the added functionality of managing devices and system
memory.
