- User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows security feature introduced in Windows Vista that is used to prevent unauthorized changes from being made to the operating system.
- UAC is used to ensure that changes to the operating system require approval from the administrator or a user account that is part of the local administrators group.
- A non-privileged user attempting to execute a program with elevated privileges will be prompted with the UAC credential prompt, whereas a privileged user will be prompted with a consent prompt.

# Requirements

- In order to successfully bypass UAC, we will need to have access to a user account that is a part of the local administrators group on the Windows target system.
- UAC allows a program to be executed with administrative privileges, consequently prompting the user for confirmation.
- UAC has various integrity levels ranging from low to high, if the UAC protection level is set below high, Windows programs can be executed with elevated privileges without prompting the user for confirmation.
