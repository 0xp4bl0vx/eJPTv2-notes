- Windows can automate a variety of repetitive tasks, such as the mass rollout or installation of Windows on many systems.
- This is typically done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility, which is used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on systems.
- This tool utilizes configuration files that contain specific configurations and user account credentials, specifically the Administrator account's password.
- If the Unattended Windows Setup configuration files are left on the target system after installation, they can reveal user account credentials that can be used by attackers to authenticate with Windows target legitimately.
- The Unattended Windows Setup utility will typically utilize one of the followingl configuration files that contain user account and system configuration information:
	- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
	- C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
- As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64.
