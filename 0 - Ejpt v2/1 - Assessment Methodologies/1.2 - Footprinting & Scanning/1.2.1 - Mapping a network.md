- OSINT
- Social Engineering

## Sniffing

- Passive Reconnaissance
- Watch network traffic  

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

This protocol resolve [[IP address]] to a [[MAC Address]]. The IP associated to a MAC is stored in ARP table of a system.

## ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

## Tools

- Wireshark: GUI tool to look at the traffic of a network
- arp-scan: find hosts using arp protocol
```
sudo apr-scan -I interface -g network
```
- ping: shows is a host is up using ICMP
```
ping -c n_of_packets IP_Address
```
- fping: send pings to all possible IP inside a network to find the ones that are up
```
fping -I interface -g network -a 2>/dev/null
```
- nmap:
![[1.1.11 - Host discovery with Nmap]]
- zenmap: GUI version of nmap, it have a topology view
- MSF module: post/multi/gather/ping_sweep
