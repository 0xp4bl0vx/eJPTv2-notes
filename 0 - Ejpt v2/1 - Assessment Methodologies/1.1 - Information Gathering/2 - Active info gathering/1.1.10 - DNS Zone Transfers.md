In certain cases DNS server admins may want to copy or transfer [[zone files]] from one DNS server to another. This process is known as a zone transfer. If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone file from the primary DNS server to another DNS server. A DNS Zone transfer can provide penetration testers with a view of an organization's network layout. Furthermore, in certain cases, internal network addresses may be found on an or organization's DNS servers.

To attack this there are tools as:
```
dnsenum domain
dig axfr @dnsserver (this is better to only do a DNS Zone Transfer)
fierce -dns domain
```
